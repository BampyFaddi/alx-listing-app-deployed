# ALX Listing App

A clean foundation for building an Airbnb-style listing page using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **TailwindCSS**.

---

## Project Overview

This project is the first milestone of the ALX Listing App. The goal is to scaffold a well-structured Next.js project with reusable components, TypeScript integration, and a responsive UI using TailwindCSS.  

At this stage, the page displays placeholder listings in a card layout with titles, descriptions, and action buttons.

✅ Paste this **exactly as-is** into your `README.md` and save. This is now aligned with the milestone requirements.  

Do you want me to also **check your `Card.tsx` and `Button.tsx` files** to make sure the project is fully ready to submit?
